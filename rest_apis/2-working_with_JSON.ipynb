    "## Detour: JSON basics in a minute or two\n",
    "[JSON](http://json.org/) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common way of serializing data in a machine readable format for sharing. It's very common to see a REST API return responses in JSON. If you've never worked with JSON before, here is a quick overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "A very simple JSON object that stores information about my dog looks like this:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"dog_name\" : \"Irma\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "On the left, is the key, or metadata describing the value on the right, my dog's actual name. A more complex structure describing me might look like this:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"dog_name\" : \"Irma\",\n",
    "    \"breed\" : \"mutt\",\n",
    "    \"coat\" : \"black and brown\",\n",
    "    \"associated_humans\" : [\"Hannah\", \"Ian\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we added more information by seperating new elements with a comma. We also made the value associated_humans a list so we could put in more than one value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hands on\n",
    "Lets try working with json in python. We'll start with the dog example above. As a technial aside, JSON is represented as a dictionary in python. The structure and syntax for dictionaries is almost exactly the same as JSON:"
