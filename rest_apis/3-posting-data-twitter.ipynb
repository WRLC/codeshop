For the purpose of this workshop, I've created a twitter account called @WRLC_Codeshop, and registered a new application at dev.twitter.com/apps. The authentication protocol is called [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth), and it's a bit outside the scope of this workshop. But the idea is that there is that we send it a set of secret tokens that identify us:"
